# Auto-Work

## Overview

Auto-Work is a whimsical and fictional application designed to simulate work on your computer, creating the illusion of productivity while you take a well-deserved break. This lighthearted tool mimics various work-related activities, such as CPU and memory usage, opening random tabs, and moving the cursor periodically.

## Disclaimer

**Note: Auto-Work is a toy repo that I use to teach git. Anything in this repo is subject to change without notice.**

## Features

- **CPU and Memory Simulation:** Auto-Work will simulate CPU and memory usage to mimic resource-intensive tasks.

- **Random Tab Opening:** The application will periodically open random tabs in the browser to create the appearance of multitasking.

- **Cursor Movement:** Auto-Work will move the cursor at irregular intervals, making it seem like you're actively engaged with your computer.

- **Configurable Settings:** Adjust the intensity and frequency of simulated work to suit your preferences.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-work.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd auto-work
   ```

3. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. Start Auto-Work:
   ```bash
   auto-work start
   ```

2. To stop the simulation and return to normal, run:
   ```bash
   auto-work stop
   ```

3. Adjust settings in `config.yml` for a customized experience.

## Configuration

Edit the `config.yml` file to tweak the simulation settings, such as the intensity of CPU and memory usage, frequency of tab openings, and cursor movement patterns.

## Example Scenario

1. **Initiate Simulation:**
   - Run `auto-work start` before taking a break.

2. **Enjoy Your Break:**
   - Take a leisurely break while Auto-Work creates the appearance of ongoing tasks.

3. **Resume Normal Work:**
   - When ready to return to work, run `auto-work stop` to end the simulation.
